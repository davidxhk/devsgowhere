**KopiJS** is a casual social gathering for engineers, designers and makers is Singapore.

We hang out together, drink kopi, and talk about almost anything.

**⚠️ JavaScript is NOT required.**

It happens on a random Saturday morning (10 AM) every 2 - 3 months.

Bring your laptops, your keyboards, your ideas, your friends.

**And bring your own money - buy your own food. :P**

Find out when's the next gathering is happening on our [Github issue board](https://github.com/KopiJS/kopi.js/issues), **Telegram** (you'll have to find the link in an issue!), on [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/kopi_js/), and on [Twitter](https://x.com/kopi_js)!
