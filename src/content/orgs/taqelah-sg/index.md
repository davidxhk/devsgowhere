## Test Automation & Quality Engineering lah! (TAQELAH)

We are a community of passionate Quality Engineers who come together to share their experiences and knowledge in Quality Engineering. 

Originally started as Singapore Appium Meetup and transformed into Test Automation & Quality Engineering group.

We conduct regular meetups/workshops through out the year.
