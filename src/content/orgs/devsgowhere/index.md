## About us

**DevsGoWhere** is a volunteer-run community in üá∏üá¨ Singapore that curates and maintains this site. üòÄ

You can sometimes catch us in person at meetups like [KopiJS](https://kopijs.org/) and other local dev events.

### Why we created DevsGoWhere

---

As developers and event organisations ourselves, we noticed a problem: it's quite hard to discover developer events in Singapore.

Different organisers are using different platforms to publish their events - some use Meetup (which charges a fee), some use Luma, some rely exclusively on Telegram or Discord. Each organisation have their own reason for using some platforms over another, but this fragmentation makes it hard for attendees to find events that matches their topic of interest.

So, we built **DevsGoWhere** as a hub for all dev events in Singapore.

Our goal is to make it easier for the community to discover, share, and attend devs events in Singapore. ‚ù§Ô∏è



### For organisers : Adding your org and event

Don't be shy! We want to help you share about your event!
