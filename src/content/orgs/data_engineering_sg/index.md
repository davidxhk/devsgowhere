We wish to nurture a local well networked community of data engineers to share know-how on all things related to data engineering, including but not limited to data pipelines, data structures, data processing & the open source tech for moving data to extract value.

This group is free & open to all data and software practitioners who wish to deepen their mastery in data engineering and with a passion of making data easily consumable to drive outcomes.

We are not affiliated to any organisation or vendor and strive to be vendor agnostic in welcoming all levels of sharing and networking.
