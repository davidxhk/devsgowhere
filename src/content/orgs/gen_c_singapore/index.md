We are a group of individuals who are passionate about contributing as a community towards building up AI talents and boosting the AI practitioner pool in Singapore. We come together to learn, discuss & experiment with Generative AI, and also run training events and workshops for the public. We run a monthly sharing session at Punggol Regional Library and the details would be posted in our various social media channels listed above.

Our community is made up of students, professional and AI enthusiasts. 

We have 5 values as below,
1) Community: Build a vibrant learning community
2) Practical: Focus on practical, real-world applications
3) Innovation: Foster innovation and experimentation
4) Collaboration: Promote knowledge sharing and collaboration
5) Accessibility: Ensure learning is shared freely and accessible to everyone
