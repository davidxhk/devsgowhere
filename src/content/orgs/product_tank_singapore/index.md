ProductTank is a meetup for product people, by product people.
It provides an opportunity for Product Managers and other product people in Singapore to exchange ideas and experiences about Product Design, Development, User Experience, and all the other things that get us excited. Events include talks from guest speakers, networking opportunities, and a good old chat over a drink or two.

We're open to product people from companies big and small. We especially welcome early stage tech startups looking to learn how to get their ideas off the ground. We also have a blog and encourage the community to get engaged by commenting on or writing new posts: [mindtheproduct.com](https://mindtheproduct.com)
