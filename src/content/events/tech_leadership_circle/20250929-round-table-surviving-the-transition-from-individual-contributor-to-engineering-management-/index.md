​\==========================

​Making the leap from individual contributor to engineering or people management is one of the most challenging transitions in a tech career. It’s no longer just about writing great code or solving technical problems — it’s about leading teams, navigating ambiguity, and enabling others to succeed. This round table will bring together experienced leaders and those new to management to share lessons learned, common pitfalls, and practical strategies for surviving — and thriving — in this critical career shift.
