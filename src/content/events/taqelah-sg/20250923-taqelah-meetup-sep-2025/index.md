🚀 Exciting News! 🚀

We’re excited to announce the TAQELAH Meetup – September 2025, proudly sponsored by **MagicPod** 🎉

Come join us for an evening of insights, networking, and community building in the QA and test engineering space.

## 🔹 Agenda

**18:30 - 19:00** - Networking and snacks

**19:00 - 19:30 - Supercharging Test Engineering with n8n Workflows by Praveen Sanap, Lead Engineer @ Carousell**

In modern test engineering, efficiency and visibility are everything. Yet, repetitive tasks, scattered integrations, and manual handoffs often slow teams down. This session explores how n8n—a powerful, low-code automation platform—can transform the way test engineers work. Attendees will learn practical use cases where n8n boosts productivity, improves test visibility, and enables engineers to focus on solving real quality challenges instead of wrestling with tools.

**19:30 - 20:00 -  Breaking Things to Build Trust by Priyangka John Jayaraj, Product evangelist @ MagicPod**

From this talk, the audience will gain a deeper understanding of how testing builds trust by delivering confidence, not just finding bugs. You will learn the importance of questioning requirements, uncovering hidden assumptions, and thinking from the user’s perspective to prevent gaps. The session will show how collaboration across QA, development, and business strengthens product quality and shared accountability. Attendees will walk away seeing testers as advocates for users and storytellers of risk, equipped with a mindset that goes beyond scripts to truly safeguard trust.

✨ Huge thanks to MagicPod for sponsoring this meetup and to Carousell for sponsoring the venue.

🎁 Bonus: We’re giving away two Google Nest Minis to two lucky attendees! 🎉
