We will be having our first meetup in 2025 in library@habourfront with two speakers:
* [Wei Yong Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-yongtan/) sharing on **Fine Tuning with PyTorch:**

Tan Wei Yong be sharing insights on how Pytorch can be utilised to fit needs with custom architecture, when APIs like HuggingFace are not enough for certain project needs. 

This talk will also share a little introduction on how to read the literature on ML, and how we can implement them.

* [S Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanand0/) will be sharing on **LLMs running Python code in loops**

Agents are commonly defined as "LLMs running tools in a loop". One very powerful tool is the ability to execute Python code. What could we unleash if LLMs run Python code in a loop? This talk explores diverse scenarios from self-healing code to hypothesis forges to cyber canaries as part of a live-coding session.
