Welcome back to **talk.JS #61**, JS enthusiasts ðŸ‘‹! We are back to take a look at some core considerations on the web platform!

First, Ivan from Rakuten will walk us through the evolution of rendering patterns - from simple client-side rendering to the fancy optimization techniques that keep modern sites running smoothly.

Then, we welcome our local community catalyst Michael (surprise, surprise!) to show us how he's rebuilding next community platforms with Astro. Take a peek at his work in action at [DevsGoWhere - talk.js May 2025](https://devsgowhere.com/events/singaporejs/talkjs_-_may_2025_web_rendering_and_more/).

Two speakers, two approaches to better web experiences. What's not to love?

This is an in-person event at [Rakuten Asia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rakuten-asia-pte-ltd/about/) office at [CapitaGreen](https://goo.gl/maps/625BdmGHjeMXjR8z6). (We truly thank Rakuten team for kindly hosting this).

I will do an intro to how we are rebuilding Engineers.SG with Astro and how easy it is to use.
