## Details

Welcome back to **talkJS #62**, JS enthusiasts ðŸ‘‹!

This month we're diving into the battle-tested strategies behind two apps protecting millions and entertaining billions daily: **ScamShield** has blacklisted over 120,000 scam entities since 2022, while Lynx powers some **TikTok**'s very critical surfaces through its Rust-powered multithreaded architecture.

Rayner will reveal the engineering decisions that keep ScamShield resilient against evolving threats, while Elio shares how TikTok LIVE achieves silky-smooth interactions at massive scale. Two different battlefields, one shared mission: ship fast without compromising user experience.

This is an in-person event at [Open Government Products (OGP)](https://share.google/58MPwYHdrIBTWzqZ2) office. (We truly thank OGP team for kindly hosting this).
