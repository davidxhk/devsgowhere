Hello AWS Community!

The cloud never stands still — and neither do we. Mark your calendars for **Wednesday, 22nd October 2025**, as the AWS User Group Singapore Meetup returns to the AWS Singapore Office.

Come ready for an evening of new ideas, live demos, and inspiring conversations. This is your chance to see what fellow builders are creating, swap stories from the field, and pick up practical insights you can take back to your own projects.  
Whether you are just getting started or running production workloads at scale, there is something here for everyone in the community.

📢 **IMPORTANT! Registration Information**  
To ensure a smooth check-in process, please take note of the following:  
✅ Confirmed attendees will receive a confirmation email before the event titled **"AWS User Group Singapore: Registration Confirmed for AWS User Group Meetup – October 2025"**. You must present this email at the Level 1 Concierge to gain access to Level 5 for attendance verification.  
🚶 Walk-ins (those without a confirmation email) will only be considered if the venue has not reached full capacity. Priority will be given to registered attendees with confirmation emails.  
🔒 Strictly enforced: No confirmation email = walk-in. Entry not guaranteed.

📅 **Date**: Wednesday, 22nd October 2025  
🕡 **Time**: 6.30pm  
📍 **Location**: AWS Singapore; 2 Central Blvd, IOI Central Boulevard East Towers, Level 5

🎤 **Meetup Track**  
✅ **Speakers & Sessions: TBC**  
📌 Stay tuned — we will update this section soon with the talks and speakers lined up for October.
