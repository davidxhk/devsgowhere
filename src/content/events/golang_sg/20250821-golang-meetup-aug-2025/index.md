ðŸ“¢ Working with Go's test cache on CI  
ðŸŽ¤ BjÃ¶rn Andersson - Principal Engineer, foodpanda  
Do you know what you can cache test results on CI so you don't have to re-run tests for code that hasn't changed between CI runs? Are you also aware that this could mean black box integration tests that depend on running services can get cached because Go doesn't know they call other services, and therefore you might have a false-positive and let buggy code out? This is a walkthrough of how Go's build cache works for tests. I'll show you how to design your test suite to benefit from caching and make sure your tests that _absolutely cannot_ be cached aren't.

BjÃ¶rn is a principal engineer at foodpanda where he spends his days figuring out how to get into production faster and how to get production back up again when it goes wrong (because it always doesâ€¦). Always ends up harping on about testing one way or anotherâ€¦

ðŸ“¢ Go embedding tips for high performance applications  
ðŸŽ¤ Loh SiuYin  
Go like C allows embedding libraries. Specifically there is the embed capability in Go's standard library. Additionally I have found embedding NATS to be particularly useful. Think message streaming, key-value and object store capability in one Go binary complete with a web frontend.

SiuYin is a long time Go developer, since version 1.0
