🧱 **10.30am - 11.00am : Topic - Securing Gen AI from the Ground Up: Infrastructure to Agentic Intelligence**

As Generative AI systems evolve from chatbots to autonomous agents, they are becoming powerful actors in our digital world — capable of learning, reasoning, and taking action. In this talk, we’ll explore how to secure the entire Gen AI lifecycle: from cloud infrastructure to model training, application logic, and agentic AI.

🤖 **11.10am - 11.40pm : Topic - Building Web Apps in the age of Gen AI**

In the era of Generative AI, we’re moving beyond code completion into a new paradigm of development. This session shows how to build web apps using AI agents – agents that spin up their own subtasks, write code, test it, and deploy, like your own mini dev team in the cloud. You’ll discover the AI-native tools that enable this new development style.
