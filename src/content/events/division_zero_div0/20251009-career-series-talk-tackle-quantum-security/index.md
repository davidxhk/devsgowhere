**Career Series: Talk & Tackle** is a dynamic initiative designed to elevate the professional development of cybersecurity practitioners. This series will feature a combination of hands-on workshops and interactive Q&A sessions, providing an engaging platform for experienced professionals to tackle pressing technical challenges in real-time.  
Each quarter, **Talk & Tackle** will focus on four distinct themes:

1.  **Red Team:** Participants will explore offensive security tactics, learning how to think like an attacker. Workshops will cover topics such as penetration testing methodologies, social engineering techniques, and the latest tools used in red teaming, equipping attendees with the skills to anticipate and counteract threats.
2.  **Blue Team:** This theme will delve into defensive strategies, emphasizing threat detection, incident response, and risk management. Attendees will engage in simulations and case studies that allow them to practice and refine their skills in protecting networks and systems against various cyber threats.
3.  **White/Yellow/Green Team:** These sessions will foster collaboration between offensive and defensive teams. We’ll address best practices in threat intelligence sharing, security policy development, and compliance measures. This integrated approach will highlight the importance of a cohesive cybersecurity strategy across different teams.
4.  **Emerging Technologies:** As technology rapidly evolves, this theme will focus on the latest advancements in cybersecurity, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain security. Participants will gain insights into how these technologies are reshaping the cybersecurity landscape and explore practical applications to enhance their own security practices.

**ABOUT THE WORKSHOP**  
Quantum safe technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), are essential for long term security and guard against future quantum threats. Unlike classical encryption methods, which can be vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers, QKD distributes keys securely using the principles of laws of physics and is resilient against quantum attacks. By integrating quantum safe technologies such as QKD, businesses can enhance their cybersecurity infrastructure to withstand emerging threats, maintaining trust and confidence in their data protection measures.

**What's covered during the workshop**

1.  Overview of quantum computing and quantum communications
2.  Quantum threats
3.  Overview of QKD and PQC in modern cryptography
4.  Introduction to the QKD protocol
5.  Integrating QKD to existing classical infrastructure

**SPEAKER'S BIO**  
**Cyril Tan** | **Quantum Security Architect, SpeQtral**  
Cyril is a 22 year old cybersecurity professional. He is a certified CISO (C|CISO) and currently holds a CISSP, CSSLP, CEH, ITIL and certified Blackblot Product Professional. He is currently a quantum security architect with SpeQtral, a local quantum communications company, which specialises in Space Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technologies. He is the leading architect for Singapore’s first quantum network, also called NQSN+. In a current evolving space of quantum, besides QKD, Cyril is also exploring in the space of quantum computing, learning different Quantum modalities, and post quantum cryptography.

In the area of cybersecurity, Cyril had deeply worked on technologies (in the R&D space) that include steganography, cryptography design, smart cards, cloud security, IoT security, OT security, product security, wireless pen testing and most recently, quantum key distribution technologies. He enjoys cybersecurity innovation, has 2 cybersecurity patents and a few cybersecurity product innovation awards (CES and Singapore Good Design).

Cyril is also an active cybersecurity EXCO member with the ISC2 Singapore Chapter, co-opt member of Cybersecurity Chapter as well as exco of Quantum Special Interest Group under Singapore Computer Society.
