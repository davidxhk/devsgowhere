# ABSTRACTS

Let's have fun and delve deep into the exciting world of threat modeling!
Welcome to our first ever meetup by Singapore's very own Threat Modeling Connect (TMC) Chapter, in collaboration with Division Zero’s Threat Modeling Quarter (TMQ).

No matter if you're an experienced practitioner with countless hours of threat modeling, or completely new to this area of cybersecurity, we want you to join our community. You’ll get to learn how threat modeling is important and accessible to different teams in the system and software development lifecycles!

# Threat Modeling 101: Is it Just “STRIDE”?

Often, the term "Threat Modelling" is related to STRIDE (in fact, a cursory Google search suggests STRIDE and PASTA).

But is threat modelling simply the use of a framework? Or is there more to it? In this talk, I will give an overview of some simple ways to view threat modelling and some best practices to deal with the fundamental questions espoused in the Threat Modelling Manifesto.

## Donavan Cheah — Cybersecurity Consultant, Thales

Donavan is a cybersecurity consultant with eight years of experience across offensive security, threat modelling, and governance, risk, and compliance. He has taught threat modelling regionally (SECCON JP, GCC 2025 @ Taiwan, Seasides @ Goa, SINCON). Donavan has been quoted in "The Pentester Blueprint" and writes for ISACA on diverse cybersecurity topics ranging from PQC to social science aspects in cybersecurity. Donavan looks at cybersecurity as a highly interdisciplinary team sport, and uses his various lenses, such as his Physics undergraduate experiences and penetration testing background to help organisations understand how their systems can go wrong, and more importantly, how to set them right.

## Ng Yoon Yik — Div0 Crew

Yoon Yik is currently is an intern at the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, where he did digital forensics and incident response. He also co-founded and is now an advisor for the NTU Cybersecurity Club. As a Global Cybersecurity Camp alumni, he is keen to bring more students and youths into the the world of threat modeling.
