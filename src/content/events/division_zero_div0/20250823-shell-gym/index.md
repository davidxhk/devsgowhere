## Details

**ABSTRACT**  
ShellGym is the regular cybersecurity workout you have been looking for! Whether you're just starting out and need some exercises, studying for a cert (hint: OSCP), looking at CTF challenges, or developing something cybersecurity-related (maybe your own automated tools?), ShellGym aims to help you progress in picking up practical cybersecurity knowledge and skills. Come and go as you please, work on your own stuff with like-minded individuals, or just have fun during the workout!

**AGENDA**  
Thematic activities for this session

-   RE without tools
-   RE with basic tools

**TRAINER**  
**KK Tan — Founder, counterShell**  
As a mid-careerist convert to cybersecurity, **Tan KK** picked up his practical skills through getting OSCP certified and by participating in a variety of CTFs. In his career at CSIT, he performed a variety of red-teaming and vulnerability research roles and established the Cyber Training School at CSIT as the Lead Instructor. Besides the OSCP certification, KK is also OSCE and OSEE certified, and has a Bachelor's degree in Social Science (Psychology). He now sees psychology as a field of study where you fuzz humans until they produce unexpected behaviour.
