**Talk 1: Java build tooling could be so much better!**

**Abstract:** The Java language is known to be fast, safe, and easy, but Java build tools like Maven or Gradle have a reputation for being slow, fragile, and confusing. This talk will explore what "could be": where current Java build tools fall behind modern build tools in other communities, in performance, extensibility, and ease of getting started. We will end with a demonstration of an experimental build tool "Mill" that makes use of these ideas, proving out the idea that Java build tooling has the potential to be much faster, safer, and easier than it is today.

**Speaker: Li Haoyi** graduated from MIT, has built core infrastructure for high-growth companies like Dropbox and Databricks, and has been a major contributor to the open source community. His projects have over 10,000 stars on Github, and are downloaded over 20,000,000 times a month. Haoyi has deep experience in the JVM and has professionally built distributed cloud backend systems, programming languages, high-performance web applications, and much more.

**Talk 2: 10 things about Virtual Threads you might want to know**

**Abstract:** Have you ever wanted to use Virtual Threads in a production application but weren’t sure if the ecosystem was ready? Are you wondering about the potential gotchas when working with Virtual Threads? Do you know which other virtual thread–related features are being introduced in Java? And are Virtual Threads really as fast as people say?

Get answers to these questions and find out whether Project Loom has delivered on its promises. First, to simplify Java's concurrency model and revive the familiar, direct style of programming. Second, to maintain the performance we've grown to love in reactive systems.

**Bio: Adam Warksi is** one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, where Ihe primarily code using Java, Scala, and other interesting technologies. He is actively involved in open-source projects, such as Ox, Jox, Tapir, sttp, Quicklens, ElasticMQ, and others. He has been speaker at major conferences, including JavaOne, Devoxx, GeeCON and ScalaDays.

In addition to writing closed- and open-source software, He spends free time exploring various (functional) programming-related subjects. Any ideas or insights he gain usually end up with a blog ([https://warski.org/articles](https://warski.org/articles))
