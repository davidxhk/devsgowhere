When I first starting out working with other SWEs in a team, I often found that I had bad habits that caused my pull requests to take longer than it should have to be merged and deployed. I wondered how to how to write proper pull requests; so that it gets deployed faster, and also "get good" at reviewing pull requests, so others get their code in faster.

Spoiler alert; it's less about writing good code and more about cultivating good personal habits.

Over the years, I've accumulated some tips and tricks so that I can do the above. I hope to share it with others starting out as software engineer (in a team) so as to short circuit their path to success.

**About Kar Rui**  
I am currently a Lead Software Engineer in OGP, in the Tooling team. Main role is to improving developer experiences by creating internal tools and libraries such as OGP's Design System, and propagating baseline engineering expectations (around testing, application best practices, etc). I have worked on many products you might have used before -- the more notable ones including FormSG, the ActiveSG rebuild, and the COVID vaccination appointment system.
