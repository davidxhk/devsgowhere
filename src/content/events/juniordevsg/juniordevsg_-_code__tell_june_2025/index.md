### Topic: Production-Ready Go: Building Robust and Scalable Services

#### Speaker:

#### Description

Shipping Go code to production is easy. Keeping it running smoothly at scale? That's a different story.

In this talk, we'll explore what it really means for a Go service to be production-ready. Drawing from real-world experience building and maintaining large-scale systems, we'll walk through key patterns and practices that help make Go services resilient, observable, secure, and maintainable.

Topics include project structuring for scalability, structured logging and metrics, robust error handling, graceful shutdowns, configuration management, testing strategies, and security best practices. You'll also learn about common pitfalls and battle-tested lessons from production outages and incidents.

Whether you're maintaining an existing codebase or preparing to ship your first Go microservice, this talk will provide you with actionable insights to level up your production-readiness game.

#### About Luo Xi

Xi is a Senior Software Engineer with experience building and maintaining large-scale, production-grade systems in Go.

### Topic: Perceived Performance: Fast Is a Feeling

#### Speaker:

Trung Vo, Engineering Manager, Ascenda<br>
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/trungvose

In web performance, there are four key areas to focus on: reducing overall load time, ensuring the site is usable as quickly as possible, enhancing smoothness and interactivity, and optimising perceived performance. This talk will dive deep into perceived performance, where perception becomes realityâ€”if a website feels fast, it is fast, regardless of the metrics. The perception of how quickly (and smoothly) pages load and respond is often more important than the actual load time, and while you may not be able to make your site physically faster, you can improve how fast it feels to users.

We'll look at proven patterns and techniques from large-scale codebases to help you make your web applications both fast and feel instant, creating smooth, engaging user experiences. Topics will include optimising loading indicators, creating instant experiences with initial data, image loading optimisation, optimistic updates and more.
