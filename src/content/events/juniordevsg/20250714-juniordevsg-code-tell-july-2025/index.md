I'll share about my journey as a student founder building a startup for Singaporean youths in the local ecosystem

- startup realities  
- how I build while balancing school  
- turning your dev project into a startup  
- insights about the local startup ecosystem  
- Agentic AI & AI industry trends

I'll also share about what I've built @ 'Sup, and give a lightning demo of our product!

**About Ace**  

I grew up around microcontrollers & python (yay RPi, yay BeagleBoard!) and started building my own robotics projects at 7 (I thought mecanum wheels were the coolest things ever). Got into software & webdev afterwards and have been working on a couple of projects in that area since. In 2024, I met my team of talented devs and we started building 'Sup, an AI-native edtech startup aiming to reshape the recruiting experience and give students/grads a leg up in career development.
