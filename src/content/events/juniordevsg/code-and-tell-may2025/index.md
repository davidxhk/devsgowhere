## Presentations

### Topic: A LLM is not Always an Expert: How and When to Train LLMs with My Company Data

Speaker:
**Francesco Gelli**, Machine Learning Scientist

LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-gelli-40014b84/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-gelli-40014b84/)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated surprising capabilities in solving a variety of general tasks, including answering complex questions, conducting extensive research, coding, and automating intricate processes.

However, the direct application of LLMs to many real-world use cases is often limited by their lack of company-specific knowledge. For example, even the most advanced LLMs today cannot match the deep expertise of investigators at PayPal, who possess detailed knowledge of complex policies and SOPs for Anti-Money Laundering and other compliance-related areas.
Building on the limitations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we will explore and try out some of the fundamental approaches for training LLMs, including continuous pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

About Francesco
