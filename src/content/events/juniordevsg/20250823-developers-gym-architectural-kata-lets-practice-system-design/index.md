\======================  
_**\*\*NO FOOD PROVIDED FOR THIS MEETUP\*\***_

We will be doing an [Architectural Kata](https://www.architecturalkatas.com/) this week.

Architectural Katas are intended as a small-group (3-5 people) exercise, usually as part of a larger group (4-10 groups are ideal), each of whom is doing a different kata. A Moderator keeps track of time, assigns Katas (or allows this website to choose one randomly), and acts as the facilitator for the exercise.

Each group is given a project (in many ways, an RFP--Request For Proposal) that needs development. The project team meets for a while, discovers requirements that aren't in the orignal proposal by asking questions of the "customer" (the Moderator), discusses technology options that could work, and sketches out a rough vision of what the solution could look like. Then, after they've discussed for a while, the project team must present their solution to the other project teams in the room, and answer challenges (in the form of hard-but-fair questions) from the other project teams.

\======================  
**What is a Kata?**

A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each.

You need to try it as many times as it takes, and be comfortable making mistakes. You need to look for feedback each time so you can work to improve.

Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at a correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.

\======================  
**Agenda:**

10:00am - Intro to Architectural Kata  
10:15am - Reveal Architectural Kata for the day  
10:20am - Group up and attempt Architectural Kata  
12:00pm - Show and Tell
