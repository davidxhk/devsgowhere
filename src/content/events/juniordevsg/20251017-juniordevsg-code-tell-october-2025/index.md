The surge of AI tools and their capabilities has stirred a range of emotions in developers worldwide: excitement, fear, and resistance. Will they replace us? Can we trust them? In this sharing, I’ll explore how I navigated this uncertainty as a mid-career shifter into tech. I’ll also discuss how I now incorporate generative AI (using the gen-e2 methodology) into my daily work as a software engineering consultant.

**About Qizhen**  
I’m Qizhen, a software engineer at PALO IT. I made the transition into tech a few years ago and have been learning ever since. These days, I’m exploring what it’s really like to work with AI day-to-day — the wins, the frustrations, and everything in between.

**Topic: CSS Layouts Done Right**

**Speaker:**  
Trung Vo, Engineering Manager, Ascenda  
LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/trungvose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trungvose)

The first time I saw CSS Grid paired with repeat(auto-fill, minmax(...)) back in 2019, it was one of those moments where I thought, "Wow, CSS is actually pretty awesome." In my short career—just about a decade—I have built layouts with tables, struggled with floats, and moved on to Flexbox and Grid. If you have been through the same evolution, you know how transformative Flexbox and Grid were.

CSS Grid support has been widely available in all major browsers since March 2017. Yet, fast forward to 2025, what amazed me back then is still something many web developers are unaware of. According to Chrome Platform Status, grid is being used in about 35% of page loads— that means a majority of websites are still not taking advantage of it. I keep coming across developers who have never used these techniques, and at the same time, new CSS features keep landing—yet they go unnoticed too.

This talk is here to change that. We will go beyond just knowing that Flexbox and Grid exist. I will cover powerful layout techniques—from simple tricks like centering elements to practical use cases like responsive forms, dynamic card layouts, sticky footers, multi-column designs without media queries. We will also explore how grid-template-areas, when used effectively, can be a game changer. Once you see its simplicity and power, you may find yourself using it far more often.  
But that is not all. While these techniques are incredibly useful, they are not new. Along the way, we will also go through a few modern CSS features like aspect-ratio, :has(), and clamp()—practical tools that can make your layouts more flexible and maintainable.

This is a highly practical talk. You will see actual code, understand how it works, and walk away with CSS patterns you can start using the very next day. If you have ever felt that CSS could be better, I hope this talk will show you just how powerful it can be!
