**Description**  
Curious about how machine learning models make predictions like spam detection or product recommendations? In this 30-minute session, we’ll walk through the basics of classification, one of the most common ML tasks. You’ll learn how to prepare your data through feature engineering, and how to improve your model’s accuracy using simple fine-tuning techniques. Designed for beginner software engineers, this talk will focus on practical steps you can apply with Python and common ML libraries like scikit-learn.
