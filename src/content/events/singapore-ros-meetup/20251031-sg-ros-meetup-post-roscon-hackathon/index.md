Join us for the Singapore ROS Community Hackathon  
Friday, October 31st, 2025, from 10:30 AM – 4:45 PM SST!

This is a unique opportunity to learn how to contribute to open-source ROS projects directly from core ROS/ROS 2 Maintainers. You'll get to meet these experts, receive problem statements from them, and work on high-priority tasks, especially those critical to industrial robotics. Whether you're a student or a professional developer, this event is designed to accelerate your open-source journey and connect you with the global ROS community. Expect dedicated coding sessions, direct mentorship, and get your hands dirty.

Food is being kindly sponsored by ROS-Industrial.
