**About the Workshop**  
At Le Wagon, our mission has always been to help professionals future-proof themselves in an ever-changing world. As AI continues to evolve at breakneck speed, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult, especially for busy working individuals, to keep up with what‚Äôs relevant, and the risk of falling behind is real.

That‚Äôs why we created this workshop - a fast, hands-on way to learn and stay relevant with practical & essential skills you can apply at work & daily life.

Join us for our free hands-on n8n 1-day workshop where you‚Äôll learn how to **build your own AI agents using n8n** - without writing a single line of code!

In just 3 hours, we‚Äôll teach you how to create simple AI agents using real-world examples, automate tasks in your work and daily life, and optimize workflows to work smarter, not harder.

Open to anyone from any background! No prior tech experience needed.

Whether you‚Äôre just curious or actively looking to stay ahead, it‚Äôs a simple, no-pressure way to stay informed without the overwhelm.

This is also a chance to meet like-minded professionals who care about staying relevant, learning continuously, and adapting to the future of work.
