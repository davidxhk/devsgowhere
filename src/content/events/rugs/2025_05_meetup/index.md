## Talks

### Title 1: Beyond the Script: Unlocking the Power of R Packages

#### Speaker: Zaw Myo Tun

Zaw is a Senior Epidemiologist at the Singapore Clinical Research Institute, where he works with diverse forms of clinical research data across multiple studies. He has over a decade of experience using R for data analysis and reporting. Zaw is passionate about helping researchers and analysts write better, shareable, and more maintainable code.

#### Talk Description

Zaw will show how modern development tools have made building R packages more approachable. Whether your goal is to streamline your code, enhance reproducibility, or share code across a team, this talk will break down the R package development process in a practical way.

### Title 2: Practical Tips to Guide Your Colleagues from Closed Source to Open Source

#### Speaker: Bella Ratmelia

Bella is a Senior Librarian in the Research and Data Services Team at SMU Libraries. Part of her role involves supporting SMU researchers and students in adopting computational methods for data analysis. She loves introducing them to open-source tools whenever possible.

#### Talk Description

Wouldn't it be great if everyone on your entire team uses R?

This talk shares practical strategies and tips for helping your fellow researchers (or students) transition from closed-source analysis software (e.g., SPSS) to the open-source world of R. Drawing from real-world success and challenges, Bella will present approaches to consider when convincing reluctant colleagues and ways to support those interested in making the switch.

### Title 3: Integrating Quarto into Teaching Practices

#### Speaker: Gerard Chung

Gerard Chung is an Assistant Professor at Department of Social Work in National University of Singapore. He worked in the community as a social worker for about 5 years before starting his academia career. He currently researches technology and AI in the social service sector. He also teaches courses on programme evaluation and technology. In his modules, he uses R to teach quantitative statistics through a series of bite-sized sessions.

#### Talk Description

While not everyone has a class to teach, having a platform and reliable workflow to manage document files and code scripts well is important for researchers and data analysts.

In this talk, Gerard will highlight some valuable lessons learnt and mistakes to avoid when creating and maintaining his course syllabus and materials using R and Quarto.
