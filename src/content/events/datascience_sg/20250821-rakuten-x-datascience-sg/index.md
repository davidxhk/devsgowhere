**Synopsis**

**Session 1:** Business Impact of Agentic AI  
Speaker: Vishal Kshirsagar

AI agents are disrupting the core business models that made the internet the bedrock for building trillion-dollar companies. Far beyond simple tools, these autonomous agents are reshaping how we work, shop, and interact. In this talk, I’ll dive into how AI agents are challenging everything from the attention economy to service delivery,  
forcing businesses to rethink their strategies. Moving beyond the typical hype, we’ll explore the real-world impact of this shift, with a focus on Rakuten’s groundbreaking work in the field. Join us to understand how the Agent Revolution is driving the next phase of innovation in the digital economy.

**Session 2:** Technology Impact of Agentic AI  
Speaker: Stephen Li

Abstract:  
Agentic AI systems demand a fundamentally different approach to how we design, develop, and deploy AI technology. From long-term memory to decision autonomy and multimodal reasoning, these systems aren’t just answering questions — they’re carrying out missions. In this talk, I’ll explore the architectural foundations of modern AI agents, the trade-offs involved in autonomy vs. control, and the technical challenges we  
face in scaling these systems responsibly. Drawing from our experience at Rakuten, I’ll share insights on how we're leveraging agentic AI to power Rakuten AI (Universal Concierge) — an AI assistant that connects users with services across shopping, travel, and more.
