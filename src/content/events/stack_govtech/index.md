## About this Meetup

Join us at this **STACK** Meetup, where our speakers will share how adopting Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) can improve reliability, scalability, and efficiency of your systems.

Grasp essential concepts of SRE with Google, explore how these concepts overlap with traditional DevOps, and understand the risks of undervaluing good SRE practices. ​

Our GovTechies will also take you through their developers’ journey, showing how SRE principles are applied to digital government products, such as APEX and StackOps. Discover how automated feedback drives continuous improvement, and why a strong SRE culture is crucial for organisations.

Join us today. Seats are limited so sign up now!
