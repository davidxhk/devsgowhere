**About this Meetup**  
As the demand for data-driven innovation grows, so does the need for secure and trustworthy data sharing. This Meetup explores two key approaches shaping the future of secure data collaboration.

Hear from TikTok about Confidential Computing (CC), an emerging technology that protects sensitive data during processing using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Discover how CC blocks unauthorised data access and enables transparency through remote attestation, with real-world use cases and open-source insights.

Next, discover [enTRUST](https://entrust.gov.sg/), a Whole-of-Government platform developed by GovTech to enable responsible and scalable data sharing between public agencies and private partners. Designed with strong governance and privacy safeguards, enTRUST ensures secure access to data without compromising agency control or citizen privacy.
