**About this Meetup**  
In a world demanding speed, scalability, security and innovation, how can we help every engineer deliver value quickly while raising the bar for software engineering in the public sector?​  
​  
Hear from GovTech on how the Software Engineering Practice team makes it easier for techies to develop great software across the public sector. They do this by building up from standardised templates and shared libraries to a Developer's Command Line Interface (CLI) that automates setup and daily tasks.​  
​  
Sharing insights from the private sector, Cloudflare will talk about building and supporting digital government platforms across Asia. From what works (and what didn’t), learn how software delivery can be reimagined to be faster, smarter and more secure.

Join us today. Seats are limited so **[sign up](https://form.gov.sg/686d345e8257efab1de33486)** now!
