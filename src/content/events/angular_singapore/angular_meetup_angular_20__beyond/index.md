Hello Angular people, how is it going?

​It has been a couple of months since our last event, and with Angular 20 just released, this feels like the perfect time to run a new meetup.

​In this session, our co-founder [Eileen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eileenchua926/) will walk us through the cool new stuff in Angular 20 — from the latest changes to what is coming next.

​Some folks are even flying in from overseas, and you will definitely spot a few familiar faces from the Angular Singapore community. Come hang out.

​Yes, food will be provided (you guessed it — Vietnamese bánh mì 🥖). Just a heads up: the food is covered from our own Angular Singapore budget, so we will not be able to cater for 50 people. Come early!

​Special thanks to [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-sg) for sponsoring the venue — right in the central area!

​See you there.
