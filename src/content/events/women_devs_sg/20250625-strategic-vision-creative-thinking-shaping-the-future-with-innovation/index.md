## Details

**Who is this for?**  
This workshop for software engineers, product managers, tech leads or aspiring product managers to elevate their thinking, break through conventional approaches, and develop a product vision that drives impact. We see more and more software engineers are thinking to transition into a product manager role, so we think this event would be useful for them. Mental models to think more outside the code, and be more product-focused!

Participants will learn how to:  
1\. Define a clear product vision that aligns with business goals and market opportunities.  
2\. Leverage creative thinking to identify unique product-market fits and solve user problems innovatively.  
3\. Develop market positioning strategies by understanding customer segments, competition, and differentiation.  
4\. Balance vision and execution—ensuring strategy translates into tangible outcomes.  
5\. Think beyond the obvious—using frameworks to challenge assumptions and uncover new opportunities.
