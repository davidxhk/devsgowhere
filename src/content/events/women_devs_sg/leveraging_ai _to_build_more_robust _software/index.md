## Details

### Tai Shi Ling's presentation
**Leveraging AI to build more robust software**

Since the launch of ChatGPT three years ago, many AI tools to assist developers have emerged, and have dramatically improved in quality and performance.

In this session, we’ll look at how we can leverage AI in our day to day coding to improve code quality and build more robust software. This session includes a live demo where Shi Ling will be refactoring an existing codebase to improve testability, maintainability, and general code quality, using a range of tools including chat-based AI, AI copilots, and agentic AIs.

### Mia’s presentation
**Build Robust Applications with AI – A case study of preventing IT operation incidents**

In today’s digital world, robust applications form the foundation of essential services. Join us to explore how AI-powered tools are contributing to the development of robust applications. Through the lens of the 2024 CrowdStrike BSoD incident, we will discuss how to prevent failures by integrating AI to build more robust applications.

### Kevin’s presentation
**Co-create with Cursor – Leveraging AI for more robust applications**

In this session, we will discuss AI opportunities and the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). We will also share insights from our success story using AI tools, including a detailed look at how we utilized Cursor to achieve significant results.
