## Details

_**Talk #1: From Junior to Senior: Engineering Clarity and Strategy in the Age of LLMs**_  
Whether you're a junior developer looking to level up or an engineering lead looking to mentor your team, I'm here to share practical steps and the mindsets needed to move from junior to mid, and from mid to senior.

In the age of LLMs, simply writing code isn't enough. We need developers who can break down complexity, anticipate risks, and design simple, maintainable systems. We need engineers, not just "code monkeys."

_**Talk #2: Building Tech for Government in 2025**_  
In 2025, technology has touched every single aspect of our lives. Hours are spent making a swipe feel more smooth, making search more relevant, and reducing friction for any transaction. We've come to expect the polish of Tiktok, Spotify or Google, but why does government technology still feel clunky at times?

I'll share my experience building tech in the government; citizen-centric design, dealing with legacy systems, and resistance to change.
