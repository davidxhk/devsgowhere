ðŸ”¹ **Synopsis:**  
With the increasing adoption of GenAI systems in production-ready applications, one question looms large: how do we know theyâ€™re reliable? This talk explores the critical need for rigorously evaluating GenAI applications and dives into practical ways to do it right. From covering common evaluation methodologies such as LLM-as-a-judge, to more sophisticated techniques like red teaming and guardrailing, the session will equip attendees with clear strategies for making GenAI systems safer, smarter, and more trustworthy.

To ground these ideas, the session will showcase hands-on examples of stress-testing models at scale using readily available frameworks. Expect a fast-paced, practical session that leaves participants with actionable techniques, toolkits, and a roadmap for evaluating their own GenAI systems with confidence.
