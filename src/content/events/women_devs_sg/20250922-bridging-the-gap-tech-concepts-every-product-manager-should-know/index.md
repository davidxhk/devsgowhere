## Details

**🔥 Bridging the Gap: Tech Concepts Every Product Manager Should Know**  
**📅 22 Sept 2025 (Mon) | 🕖 7–9 PM | 📍 Open Government Products**

✨ **Disclaimer**  
We welcome everyone to our events. That being said, we always recommend any male attendees to bring a +1 female friend to join our events! So do share it with your female colleagues / friends!

🔹 **Synopsis:**  
Great products are built where technology meets strategy—but too often, technical concepts feel like a “black box” for Product Managers. This session unpacks the core tech ideas every PM should understand to communicate effectively with developers, scope features realistically, and make smarter product decisions.

From APIs to architecture, testing to trade-offs, you’ll learn how software is really built, why “simple” changes aren’t always simple, and how to balance speed, cost, and quality. We’ll also explore emerging trends like AI and cloud systems, giving you a toolkit to ask the right questions and avoid common pitfalls.

Walk away with practical analogies, real-world examples, and the confidence to partner with your engineering team more effectively.
