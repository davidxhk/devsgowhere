✨**Synopsis**  
Artificial Intelligence isn’t just hype — it’s already shaping how companies design products, write code, test systems, and automate everyday workflows. But for many software engineers, AI is still something they “mean to explore” but haven’t dived into yet.

Hosted by [Saloni Kaur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saloni-kaur/), in this 45-minute hands-on session, we’ll break down the core concepts behind today’s AI wave — from **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to **AI Agents** and **MCP Servers** — and show you exactly how they’re being used in real-world engineering teams. You’ll learn how tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **Claude**, and **company-specific AI automations** fit into daily dev work.

We’ll also do a **live demo using Windsurf**, starting a fresh AI-powered automation project and then showcasing a completed one, so you can see what’s possible end-to-end. Along the way, we’ll discuss how to **test and validate AI outputs**, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

You’ll walk away with:  
• A clear understanding of modern AI concepts and how they interconnect  
• Real-world examples of AI in production  
• Practical tips for using AI tools daily as a developer  
• Inspiration and a roadmap for starting your own AI projects

Expect a fun, playful vibe — we’ll keep it practical, interactive, and maybe just a little bit cheeky.
