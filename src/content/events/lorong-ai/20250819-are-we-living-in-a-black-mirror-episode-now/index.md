​From AI that understands your emotions better than your best friend, to digital companions you can chat with, to memorial bots that let you 'talk' to the departed—the future is here, and it's fascinatingly strange. Join us for a fun and thought-provoking exploration of empathetic and emotional AI with just enough to make you wonder if you are living in the next Black Mirror episode.

## ​More About the Sharings

-   ​[Mabel Loh](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/mabelohyushan?referrer=luma) is revolutionizing women's health through Maibel, an emotionally intelligent AI companion that understands the unique complexities of women's wellness journeys. As a former educator and women's health coach, she's witnessed firsthand how traditional health solutions fail women. She's building autonomous AI coaching agents that adapt to women's unique needs through story-driven experiences and empathetic conversations. Her vision: AI systems that don't just track symptoms but truly understand women's bodies, learn from their patterns, and evolve alongside them_. (Technical Level: 100)_
    

-   ​[Jeremy](https://jeremysoo.com) is pioneering High-EQ AI agents at [Curve Labs](https://curvelabs.org/) with the aim of building AI personas that are indistinguishable from people. He believes in making impossible possible, and draws on his work as architect-engineer of Emotionally-Aware Mixture-of-Agents (EmMA) to explore techniques for safety alignment, novel data curation, and cognition-first model orchestrations. The next frontier as he sees it, is autonomous AI you can see, text, call, and truly connect with — at least till the robots arrive. _(Technical Level: 200)_
    

-   ​[Wen Rui (Senior Product Manager, GovTech)](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/liauwenrui) and [Justin Ng (Systems Engineer, GovTech)](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/justin-ng-jin) will be sharing more about AfterLifeSG, a trial product by GovTech with the vision of becoming the default platform for Singapore residents to host memorials of their departed loved ones, and for other residents to share their treasured memories of the departed. He will share more about how the product started as an idea from a hackathon to its beta release with public officers, whilst always maintaining a wicked sense of humor. By exploring having GenAI-powered chatbots to chat with the deceased, Are We Living in a Black Mirror Episode Now? _(Technical Level: 100)_
    

​Through real-world examples and live demonstrations, we'll examine how AI is pushing the boundaries of human-machine interaction, raising questions about connection, consciousness, and what it means to be human in an increasingly AI-enhanced world.

-   ​**[Mabel Loh](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/mabelohyushan?referrer=luma)** is the founder of Maibel. A former educator and women's health coach, she’s building Maibel from first principles: designing autonomous coaching agents, crafting multi-modal experiences, and exploring orchestration-first architectures that mirror how real humans grow, spiral, and self-correct. Her excitement lies in AI-native workflows, emotional interfaces, and self-evolving AI systems that learn from users, not just react to them.
